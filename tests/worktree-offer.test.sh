# End-to-end tests for worktree auto-locking against a real git repo.
#
# Drives maybe_offer_worktree_locks() with a linked worktree that is "hidden"
# (outside the mounted roots) and asserts that:
#   - the hidden worktree is actually locked with our owner token,
#   - cleanup removes the owner and unlocks it again,
#   - a pre-existing STALE mutex does NOT prevent locking (the reported bug:
#     the offer used to bail out and launch the container unprotected).
#
# Scripts are sourced with CLAUDE_CONTAINED_LIB_ONLY=1 so only the helpers run.
#
# Usage: tests/worktree-offer.test.sh
